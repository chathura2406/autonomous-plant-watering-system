# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System (Embedded + GSM)

A low-cost autonomous irrigation controller that monitors soil moisture and temperature to optimize watering and prevent water wastage.
The system notifies the user via SMS whenever irrigation occurs, enabling remote monitoring without internet connectivity.

---

## 📌 Problem

Traditional irrigation requires manual inspection and often leads to:

* Overwatering
* Water wastage
* Plant damage due to heat evaporation
* Continuous human monitoring

---

## 💡 Solution

This system automatically decides when to water plants based on environmental conditions and alerts the farmer using GSM communication.

---

## 🧠 Features

* Soil moisture sensing
* Temperature-aware watering logic
* Automatic pump control
* LCD real-time monitoring
* SMS notification using SIM800L
* Calibrated sensor readings
* Non-blocking embedded design

---

## 🛠 Hardware Used

* Arduino Uno
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* DHT11 Temperature Sensor
* Relay Module + Water Pump
* SIM800L GSM Module
* 16x2 I2C LCD

---

## ⚙️ Working Logic

Watering occurs only if:

Dry Soil AND Safe Temperature (<35°C)

Prevents watering during hot periods to reduce evaporation loss.

---

## 📷 System Architecture

Sensors → Microcontroller → Decision Engine → Pump + GSM + Display

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* IoT Cloud Dashboard (ESP8266)
* Mobile App Monitoring
* Data logging & analytics
* Weather prediction integration
